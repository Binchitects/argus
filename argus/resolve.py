"""Resolve `#include` strings to concrete files, across repos.

A wrong edge here is invisible. It silently corrupts `repo_deps`, which feeds
the centrality term behind every `which_repo` answer, and nothing downstream
can tell a fabricated dependency from a real one. So this module guesses at
nothing: an include it cannot pin to exactly one file is recorded as
unresolved with a reason, and contributes no edge.
